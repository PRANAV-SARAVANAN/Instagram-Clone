An Instagram clone is a social media platform that replicates the fundamental features of Instagram, allowing users to share photos and videos, apply filters, follow other users, like and comment on posts, and engage through direct messaging. It typically includes profile customization, explore/discover sections, hashtag search, and notifications for user activity. While variations may exist, the clone aims to provide a similar user experience to Instagram, fostering social interaction and content sharing within its community.
